We focus here on the effects of *bin size*  - a parameter setting that is often left for the  default settings (which may mean that they are automatically set to values based on the data). This is fine, most of the time, but sometimes it can misrepresent the data or even be directly misleading.\n",

The interval is defined as the time between speech offset from a first speaker to speech onset of a second speaker, in dialogue, when the current speaker shifts. Positive intervals means that there was a silent gap between the speakers utterances, Negative intervals mean that there was some speech overlap, and 0 interval means that the second speaker started just as the first stopped.\n",
